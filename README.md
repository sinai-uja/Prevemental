# PREVEMENTAL

Prevemental is the first parental control app that prevents emotional disorders in young people.

It offers monitoring of the language used on social networks, without invading the privacy of the supervised accounts, thanks to an advanced artificial intelligence capable of estimating risk levels in problems such as bulimia, anorexia, depression or anxiety.

Prevemental is developed by the SINAI research team at the University of Ja√©n, as part of the BigHug Project, funded by grant P20_00956 (PAIDI 2020) from the Andalusian Regional Government.
